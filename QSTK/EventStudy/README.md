## Event Study ##

Creates an event study profile to assess the impact of stock price events (information) on future prices.

An event study profile makes it possible to consider questions such as:

1. Is it possible to make money using this event?
2. If it is possible, what investing strategy could be used? I.e., when to buy, when to sell, how long to hold ...
3. Is this a risky strategy?
4. What is the expected return on each trade?
5. How often does this event occur?
6. Is there some way to reduce the risk?
